                       awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day go for and work with the

                       make Apple greater than before it was. But i will dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man i will never forget him.

                        What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written as an
                         adult(and certainly every one that has been published), almost every email. I've ever witten, 
                         has been written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before 
                         I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped me to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. 
                         And through his vision, i have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed Mr Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.
